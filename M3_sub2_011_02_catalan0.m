% ENGR 132 
% Program Description 
% This subfunction cleans noisy data using a moving average filter.
% It preserves all data points and handles NaN values gracefully.

%% INITIALIZATION
[rows_size, column_size] = size(speed_data); %Assigns values to each 
                                             %variable which is the size of
                                             %the row or column.
avg_speed_data = nan(rows_size - 1, column_size); % We're only getting
                                                  % "size - 1" averages

%% CALCULATIONS
for ii = 1:column_size
    for jj = 1:rows_size - 1 % Stops at second-to-last point so it stays in
                             % bounds, same reason as stated earlier
        if ~isnan(speed_data(jj,ii)) && ~isnan(speed_data(jj+1, ii))
            avg_speed_data(jj,ii) = ((speed_data(jj,ii) + ...
                speed_data(jj+1,ii)) / 2); 
            % Average of the two becomes new data point. We also use 
            % ~isnan because this actually returns a 1 or 0 that we can use
            % in our conditional statement
 
        else
            avg_speed_data(jj,ii) = (nan); 
            % If the value we are observing is nan then it just stays nan
